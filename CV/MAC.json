      "description": "I have been always passionate about building things and making friends, that drives me to join to product-focused companies, where people come together to change the world.\n\nSomething about me is that I'm proactive, always motivated, and driven to make positive changes for people, the team, or the community. I firmly believe that technology serves as a conduit rather than an end in itself—its true purpose lies in addressing human challenges.\n\nThroughout my professional journey, I have cultivated a dual mindset—equally dedicated to product development and site reliability.  This synergy has enabled me to collaboratively ideate with product managers and designers, thereby uncovering novel perspectives. \nMeanwhile, my experience in site reliability has enabled me to enhance skills in areas such as continuous delivery, observability, resilience and infrastructure.\n\nOver time, I've developed a passion for observability, as I believe it has the potential to empower us to create exceptional software and provide even better service to our customers.\n\nI see myself as a product engineer with a diverse skill set, consistently pursuing a holistic perspective. Also, my commitment to teamwork ensures to deliver of top-notch product. ",

The way of system understanding changed radically for everyone. A combination of this and the introduction of incident procedures made that very similar incidents went from being resolved in days to hours.\n\nI worked a lot evangelizing the teams about observability and continuous delivery, supported by internal libraries that I developed to improve the developer experience and accelerate the adoption of the new observability approach.\n\nMostly all our infrastructure operational work in AWS and other platforms, like MongoDB Atlas, was done using Terraform."
